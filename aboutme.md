Throughout my career, I have gained experience in various roles, including desktop and server support, computer programming, and management of technical teams.

In 2019, I pursued a Master's degree in Digital Mapping from the University of Kentucky to further explore my passion for maps and cartography. This educational journey provided me with valuable skills in creating custom maps and enhanced my proficiency in critical thinking, programming, and data science.

Maps have always captivated me, and with my specialized training, I can now combine my technical expertise with my fascination for cartography. Additionally, my master's program expanded my knowledge in crucial areas that complement my work, allowing me to approach challenges with a well-rounded perspective.
