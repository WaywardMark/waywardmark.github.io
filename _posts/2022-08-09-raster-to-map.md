This Github repository documents the processes involved in converting raster data to vector polygons for map evaluation. It includes a Python Jupyter notebook that facilitates the transformation of National Land Cover Database raster data into vector polygons. The notebook automates several shell commands and incorporates processes to add JSON properties to the GeoJSON file, enabling the presentation of the geojson data using ipyleaflet.

**The repository consists of the following components:**

Python Jupyter notebook: This notebook processes the National Land Cover Database raster data, converting it into vector polygons. It automates various shell commands and includes steps to add JSON properties to the GeoJSON file, allowing for seamless presentation and visualization of the data using ipyleaflet.

Leaflet Map (index.html): The repository also includes a Leaflet map named index.html. This map provides a larger format for evaluating the data compared to ipyleaflet within the notebook.

Data Source:
The raster data used in this notebook are sourced from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium website. The MRLC website offers the MRLC NLCD Viewer tool, which allows users to select specific regions within the United States and download the corresponding land cover raster data.

Environment Setup:
To run the Jupyter notebook, you need to set up a Python environment. Follow these Conda commands to create the environment and install the necessary libraries:

```bash
conda create -n raster-to-vector-env python
conda activate raster-to-vector-env
conda install -c conda-forge geopandas pandas numpy jupyterlab geojson ipyleaflet
```

These commands will create a new environment named raster-to-vector-env, activate it, and install the required libraries: Geopandas, Pandas, NumPy, JupyterLab, GeoJSON, and ipyleaflet.

To explore the data in more detail, you can use the expanded Leaflet map provided in the index.html file. This map offers a larger format for evaluating the converted data compared to ipyleaflet within the notebook.

The repository provides a comprehensive resource for converting raster data to vector polygons and evaluating maps effectively. The Python Jupyter notebook automates the conversion process, and the accompanying Leaflet map enhances the visualization experience.

The conversion of raster data to vector polygons opens up numerous possibilities for map evaluation and analysis. Access the repository and leverage the power of data-driven maps to explore and analyze spatial information.

Stay tuned for more updates and projects as we continue our exploration of map evaluation and geospatial analysis!
